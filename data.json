cancer cells from both metabolic and oxidative stress-induced cell death, and facilitates cancer metastasis. further, ampk critically maintained the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (pdh), the rate limiting enzyme involved in tca cycle, thus favoring the pyruvate metabolism towards tca cycle rather than converting it to lactate. mechanistically, ampk was shown to co-localize with pdha, the catalytic subunit of pdh, in the mitochondrial matrix and directly triggered the phosphorylation of pdha on ser295 and ser314. hyper-phosphorylation of ser295 and ser314 of pdha promotes lung

nevertheless be anticipated, in part, on the basis of the extent of binding of the drug to plasma proteins, the capacity of the liver for extracting the drug from blood passing through the liver and the true distribution space of the drug. highly bound drugs with low intrinsic hepatic clearance are among the most commonly reported to have their kinetics altered by ethanol (e.g. benzodiazepines, phenytoin, tolbutamide and warfarin). less highly bound drugs are less consistently affected (e.g. meprobamate, glutethimide, pentobarbitone and phenobarbitone). acute administration of ethanol to laboratory animals or incubation of microsomal preparations with ethanol inhibits the mixed function oxidase activity. in the human, the elimination half-life of meprobamate, pentobarbitone and

content and cytochrome p450 and results in an augmentation in drug metabolising ability of the microsomes in vitro. even though the plasma half-life of some drugs is decreased by chronic ethanol ingestion, the clinical determination of the mechanism is incomplete because few studies have measured drug metabolite levels. in addition, alcohol effects on drug distribution have not been studied

methylenes added to the chain length, showing that the initial stage in inhibitor binding occurs at a non-polar region of the protein. this region is probably located at the enzyme active site, since inhibition was prevented by acetoacetyl-coa or acetyl-coa but not by coa. the site of modification by chloromethyl ketone derivatives of fatty acids is restricted to a thiol group, since inactivation of the enzyme was prevented by reversible thiomethylation of the active-site thiol. in contrast, an amino-directed reagent, citraconic anhydride, still inactivated the enzyme, even when the active-site thiol was protected. evidence that the enzyme thiol was particularly reactive came from studies on the ph-dependence of the alkylation reaction and thiol-competition experiments. inhibition of the enzyme proceeded suprisingly well at acidic ph values and a 10(5) molar excess of external thiol over active-site thiol was required to prevent inhibition by 0.3 mm-9-chloro-8-oxononanoic acid. in addition to inhibiting isolated acetoacetyl-coa thiolase, in hepatocytes the chloromethyl ketone derivatives of fatty acids also inhibited chloresterol synthesis,

individual adaptation to the advancing pregnancy. the regression in placental metabolic capacity after day 15 of gestation was also evident by the decrease in glucose uptake and its channelling to

nevertheless be anticipated, in part, on the basis of the extent of binding of the drug to plasma proteins, the capacity of the liver for extracting the drug from blood passing through the liver and the true distribution space of the drug. highly bound drugs with low intrinsic hepatic clearance are among the most commonly reported to have their kinetics altered by ethanol (e.g. benzodiazepines, phenytoin, tolbutamide and warfarin). less highly bound drugs are less consistently affected (e.g. meprobamate, glutethimide, pentobarbitone and phenobarbitone). acute administration of ethanol to laboratory animals or incubation of microsomal preparations with ethanol inhibits the mixed function oxidase activity. in the human, the elimination half-life of meprobamate, pentobarbitone and tolbutamide is increased by acute ethanol administration. chronic administration of ethanol to rats and humans causes proliferation of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, increase in microsomal protein

biotin-carboxyl carrier protein, (2) the biotin carboxylase, and (3) the carboxyl transferase. in the second group, as represented by beta-methylcrotonyl coa-carboxylase from achromobacter only two types of polypeptides are present. the one carries the biotin carboxylase activity together with the biotin-carboxyl-carrier protein, the other one carries the carboxyl transferase activity. in this

the animal tissues acetyl coa-carboxylase is under metabolic control, as known from previous studies. it thus has to be expected that the levels of malonyl coa in livers of rats in all states of depressed fatty acid synthesis are much lower than under normal conditions because the carboxylation of acetyl coa is strongly reduced and cannot keep pace with the consumption of malonyl coa by fatty acid synthetase. a new highly sensitive assay method for malonyl coa was developed which uses tritiated nadph and measures the incorporation of radioactivity into the fatty acids formed from malonyl

(1) how long an exposure to dmso is necessary to induce the differentiation of these cells; and (2) what is the fate of the differentiating cells when dmso is removed from the medium. exposure to dmso for less than 24 hours failed to produce any detectable evidence of erythroid differentiation. on the other hand, culture in the presence of dmso for 24 hours followed by culture in dmso-free medium

properties of tissue fractions from rat brain homogenates have been examined. of the three fractions studied (presynaptic nerve terminals, mitochondria and fragmented membranes), only the nerve terminals (synaptosomes) have the ability to accumulate 42k from physiological salt solutions. 2. the ability to accumulate and retain k is lost if synaptosomes are exposed to very hypotonic solutions. the k uptake and total k content is reduced by ouabain and by inhibitors of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. 3. these results suggest that synaptosomes in physiological saline accumulate k against a concentration gradient, and may have k diffusion potentials across their surface membranes. the voltage-sensitive fluorescent probe, 3,3'-dipentyl 2,2'-oxacarbocyanine (cc5), was used to test this possibility. 4. in the squid axon, the fluorescent emission of cc5 is directly proportional to membrane potential; depolarization causes an increase in fluorescence. 5. the fluorescence of synaptosomes ('synaptosome fluorescence') treated with cc5 is increased when [k]o is increased or [k]o is reduced; replacement of external na by li or choline has little effect on the synaptosome fluorescence. in quantitative terms, synaptosome fluorescence is proportional to log ([k]o plus 0-05[na]o). rb is about as effective as k in enhancing synaptosome fluorescence; cs is about 1/4 as effective. the effect of increased [k]o is reversible. 6. the fluorescence data provide corroborative evidence that there is normally a large k gradient ([k]o smaller than [i]i) across the synaptosome surface membrane. the data suggest the [k]i may be in excess of 100 mm. 7. replacement of cl- by methylsulphate did not significantly affect the relationship between synaptosome fluorescence and [k]o, nor did removal of external ca. 8. the fluorescence of cc5-treated mitochondria, membrane fragmnets, or lysed synaptosomes is unaffected by changes in the k concentration of the medium. 9. veratridine and gramicidin d, both of which enhance na permeability (pna) in some intact tissues, increase synaptosome fluorescence when added to the standard medium. the increment is greatly reduced or abolished when external na is replaced by choline. 10. if synaptosomes are first na-loaded (by pre-treatment with cyanide + iodoacetate), and then placed in a choline medium, addition of gramicidin d significantly decreases fluorescence. this effect could be explained if, with [na]o smaller than [na]i, the increase in pna causes the synaptosomes to hyperpolarize. 11. the veratridine-induced increase in synaptosome fluorescence was prevented by 3 times 10- minus 7m tetrodotoxin, which also blocks the depolarizing effect of veratridine in intact neurones. 12. the main

mitochondria the apparent km was decreased to 60 mum atp. inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase by exogenous atp was sensitive to atractyloside, suggesting that pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase acts internally to the atractyloside-sensitive barrier. the divalent cation ionophore, a23187, enhanced the loss of dehydrogenase activity. pyruvate dehydrogenase activity is regulated additionally by pyruvate, inorganic phosphate, and adp. pyruvate, in the presence of rotenone, strongly inhibited inactivation. this suggests that pyruvate facilitates its own oxidation and that increases in pyruvate dehydrogenase activity by substrate may provide a modulating influence on the utilization of pyruvate via the tricarboxylate cycle. inorganic phosphate protected the dehydrogenase from inactivation by atp. adp added to the incubation mixture together with atp inhibited the inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase. this protection may result from a direct action on pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, as adp competes with atp, and an indirect action, in that adp competes with atp for the translocase. it is suggested that the intramitochondrial [atp]:[adp] ratio effects the kinase activity directly, whereas the cytosolic [atp]:[adp] ratio acts indirectly. mg2+ enhances the rate of reactivation of the inactivated pyruvate dehydrogenase presumably by accelerating the rate of dephosphorylation of

syrian hamsters was administered a toxic dosage of acetaminophen (600 mg . per kg . intraperitoneally) while another group was treated with the same dosage of acetaminophen, followed 1 hour later by cysteamine (200 mg . per kg . intraperitoneally). the animals were sacrificed at 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours. microsomal fractions were isolated for biochemical assays, and liver sections were prepared for electron microscopy. results showed that significant enhancement of lipid peroxidation occurred in the untreated acetaminophen-poisoned group, as compared to the cysteamine-treated group. glucose 6-phosphatase activity was markedly suppressed at 6, 12, and 18 hours after acetaminophen administration. cysteamine treatment completely prevented the curtailment of nadph-cytochrome c reductase and glucose 6-phosphatase activities in the protected group, and partially maintained aniline hydroxylase activity. cytochrome p-450 level was unaffected in both the cysteamine-treated and the untreated

untreated acetaminophen-poisoned group. at 18 and 24 hours, sinusoidal congestion and myeloid figure formation were prominent. in the cysteamine-protected group, polysomes reassembled around the granular endoplasmic reticulum at 18 hours. it is postulated that lipid peroxide formed in vivo may facilitate the microsomal oxidation of acetaminophen to the toxic metabolite. nadph-cytochrome c reductase is likely to be the locus within the nadph-cytochrome p-450 electron transport chain susceptible to lipoperoxidation. the free radical-related lipoperoxidation may mediate the impairment of in vitro drug metabolism, as reflected by the depressed aniline hydroxylase activity. the abnormal phospholipid metabolism is manifested at the fine structural level by the myeloid body formation. the

soft tissue calcification when ingested by cattle. an extract of this plant restores calcium absorption depressed by dietary strontium blockage of 1,25-(oh)2d3 formation in chicks. we gave an aqueous extract of s. malacoxylon to diabetic rats and restored duodenal calcium absorption to normal. these findings provide further evidence of the ability of a factor in the s. malacoxylon extract to mimic the actions of 1,25-(oh)2d3 on duodenal calcium transport and reinforce the hypothesis that abnormal vitamin d metabolism is an important determinant of depressed duodenal calcium absorption in

have been studied. since (a) km value for mgadp- (0.05 mm) and creatine phosphate (0.5 mm) are significantly lower than km for mgatp2- (0.7 mm) and creatine (5.0 mm) and (b) maximal rate of the reverse reaction (creatine phosphate + adp leads to atp + creatine) equal to 3.5 mumol times min-1 times mg-1 is essentially higher than maximal rate of the forward reaction (0.8 mumol times min-1 times mg-1), atp synthesis from adp and creatine phosphate is kinetically preferable over the forward reaction. 2. a possible regulatory role of mg2+ ions in the creatine phosphokinase reaction has been tested. it has been shown that in the presence of all substrates and products of the reaction the ratio of the rates of forward and reverse reactions can be effectively regulated by the concentration of mg2+ ions. at limited mg2+ concentrations creatine phosphate is preferably synthesized while at high mg2+ concentrations (more atp in the reaction medium) atp synthesis takes place. 3. the kinetic (mathematical) model of the mitochondrial creatine phosphokinase reaction has been developed. this model accounts for the existence of a variety of molecular forms of adenine nucleotides in solution and the formation of their complexes with magnesium. it is based on the assumption that the mitochondrial creatine phosphokinase reactions mechanism is analogous to that for soluble isoenzymes. 4. the dependence of the overall rate of the creatine phosphokinase reaction on the concentration of total mg2+ ions calculated from the kinetic model quantitatively correlates with the experimentally determined dependence through a wide range of substrates (atp, adp, creatine and creatine phosphate) concentration. the analysis of the kinetic model demonstrates that the observed regulatory effect of mg2+ on the overall reaction rate can be expained by (a) the sigmoidal variation in the concentration of the mgadp- complex resulting from the competition between atp and adp for mg2+ and (b) the high affinity of the enzyme to mgadp-. 5. the results predicted by the model for the behavior of mitochondrial creatine phosphokinase under conditions of oxidative

of hypercholesterolaemic humans and animals generally results in a significant reduction in plasma cholesterol concentration. while most studies relating ascorbic acid to atherosclerosis have used the rabbit as a model, those concerned with elucidating the role of ascorbic acid in the regulation of cholesterol metabolism have generally used the guinea pig. comparatively little use has been made of the non-human primates. a significant advance in recent years has been the development of a model of chronic latent scurvy in the guinea pig. chronic dietary inadequacy of vitamin c may  influence the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis as it affects not only plasma cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations but also the integrity of the vascular wall. ascorbic acid is involved in the regulation of cholesterol metabolism in several ways. dietary inadequacy of vitamin c is associated indirectly with a lowering of cholesterol absorption, this effect resulting from a reduction in the availability of bile acids, monoglycerides and fatty acids. the excretion of cholesterol as neutral steroids, however, appears not to be affected by ascorbic acid. although much of the evidence for the involvement of ascorbic acid in cholesterol synthesis is equivocal, it seems likely that cholesterol synthesis is decreased in vitamin c deficiency. a series of studies using guinea pigs with chronic latent vitamin c deficiency has provided clear evidence that bile acid synthesis is reduced in this condition. indirect evidence strongly suggests that this results from a decrease in the activity of the microsomal enzyme cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase. however, some evidence suggests that the mitochondrial reactions of bile acid synthesis require ascorbic acid. the role of ascorbic acid in the

important role for urea formation, therefore the liver concentration of ornithine was also determined. the contents of ammonia in plasma were the same in these two groups and the ammonia content in liver of rats fed the control diet was smaller than that of rats fed the protein free diet supplemented with methionine and threonine. the contents of some amino acids in tissues were significantly reduced. the concentrations of aspartic acid, glutamic acid, alanine and serine in plasma and liver of rats fed the protein free diet supplemented with methionine and threonine were, particularly, significantly reduced as compared with those of rats fed the protein free diet. in addition to the decrease of free amino acids which are considered to be nonspecific nitrogen carriers from the peripheral tissues, the concentration of ornithine in liver was also significantly reduced. the results suggest that the decreased migration of free amino acids from peripheral tissues to the

also able to resuscitate the cells. other substrates tested (lactate, acetate, alpha-ketoglutarate, or glyoxylate) were unable to restore motility in rutamycin-treated cells. in the presence of pyruvate, the phosphorylation uncoupler, carbonylcyanide-p-trifluoromethyoxphenylhydrazone, reduced motility and atp to common levels in untreated cells or cells treated with rutamycin or rotenone. pyruvate is thus metabolized to produce atp by a pathway independent of oxidative phosphorylation associated with the electron transport chain. 5-methoxyindole-2-carboxylic acid, an inhibitor of lipoyldehydrogenase, prevented the increase of motility and atp in rutamycin-treated cells, indicating that alpha-keto acid oxidation is involved in the production of atp from pyruvate when rutamycin is present. with pyruvate present, bongkrekic acid, antimycin a, and anaerobiosis eliminated motility, reduced atp to low levels, and also significantly reduced the rate of pyruvate metabolism. acetate was produced from pyruvate only when cellular atp concentrations were low. decreases in free carnitine concentrations showed that pyruvate initially used was converted to acetylcarnitine. the results indicate that the intramitochondrial lactate dehydrogenase x, which is unique to spermatozoa, allows the nadh resulting from pyruvate oxidation to reduce other pyruvate molecules to lactate.

4-fold and allowed limited rates of oxidative phosphorylation. when spermatozoa treated with filipin were supplemented with malate, there was a rapid, almost linear rate of pyruvate metabolism which was slightly increased by l-carnitine. in the absence of malate, 20 to 30% of the pyruvate used was reduced to lactate; this increased to 57% in the presence of malate. without malate, about 90% of the pyruvate metabolized was converted to lactate and acetate or l-acetylcarnitine. rutamycin or rotenone increased both the rate of pyruvate use and the delta lactate/deltapyruvate ratio. under all treatments, l-carnitine consistently reduced the percentage of pyruvate converted to lactate by about 10%; part of the pyruvate was preferentially shunted into l-acetylcarnitine rather than lactate. the mitochondrial inhibitors, rotenone or rutamycin, did not change the amount of pyruvate that was converted to metabolites other than lactate, or l-acetylcarnitine, or both. pyruvate-supported state

i),[14c]tdhf was infused intravenously. most of the compound was secreted rapidly in bile chemically unchanged. the biliary secretion of this drug produced a twofold increase in bile flow; however, the bile salt output was markedly reduced during the infusion. in spite of this reduction, the phospholipid output remained essentially unchanged whereas the cholesterol output increased almost twofold. in five other animals (group ii), the effect of tdhf on the bile salt secretion was further investigated by an intravenous infusion of [14c]taurocholate followed by a combined infusion of [14c]taurocholate and tdhf. when tdhf was added to the infusate, a reduction in the [14c]taurocholate output and a progressive rise in the plasma [14c]taurocholate concentration were observed in each animal. an analysis of the data in both groups indicates that (a) the most likely explanation to account for the decreased bile salt output is that the bile salt analogue, tdhf, interfered with bile salt secretion into the biliary canaliculi; (b) tdhf induces a greater secretion of biliary water than was observed with bile salts, an effect consistent with a stimulation of the bile salt-independent canalicular flow; (c) at similar 3alpha-hydroxysteroid secretion rates tdhf caused a significant increase in cholesterol secretion compared to that induced by bile salt. this finding suggests that tdhf affects cholesterol metabolism or secretion in a way distinct from bile salts. thus, the solubilization of biliary lipids in mixed micelles, although essential, is only one of the factors which determine their secretion into bile.", {"entities": [[2023, 2045, "PATHWAY"]]}], ["oxidative phosphorylation and respiratory enzyme concentrations of liver mitochondria and glucose

to lowered levels of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate:homocysteine methyltransferase, creating a functional folate deficiency by 'trapping' an increased proportion of folate as the methyl derivative. in addition, as methyltetrahydrofolate is a poor substrate for folylpoly-gamma-glutamate synthetase, there is a decreased synthesis of pteroylpolyglutamates, the forms of the vitamin that are preferentially retained by tissues. this results in decreased tissue folate levels under conditions of vitamin b-12 deficiency. vitamin b-12 and methionine deficiency had no significant effect on the

postulated that selenium may not be a direct inducer of heme oxygenase as is the case with trace metals such as cobalt, but may mediate an increase in heme oxygenase through increased production and cellular availability of \"free\" heme, which results from the increased heme synthetic activity of hematocytes. subsequently, the increased heme oxygenase activity is in turn responsible for the lack of increase in the microsomal heme content, thus maintaining heme levels at normal values despite the highly increased activities of both heme oxygenase and delta-aminolevulinate synthase. it is further suggested that the increase in delta-aminolevulinate synthase activity is not due to a decreased rate of enzyme degradation or an activation of preformed enzyme, but to increased rate of

both use energy to drive active transport to all solutes and also conserve energy in the form of adenosinetriphosphate (atp) is descirbed. the basic assumption is that injection of energy results in a conformational change of the membrane which both generates transient highly-ordered water structures on its inside surface and changes membrane permeability. ordered water is propagated through the cell by means of cooperative interactions with proteins, so that during the ordered period intracellular water is incompatible with small cations which require strong primary hydration, but has enhanced affinity for water-structure-breaking solutes. in animal cells cytoplasmic water is ordered by the activity of the plasma-membrane-bound transport atpases. in mitochondria and bacteria the state of ordered water is identified with the energised state, which can be generated either by passage of electrons down the electron chain, or by atpase activity. the mechanism is shown to be

of 5- phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (pp-ribose-p) synthetase--result in hyperuricemia, and are associated with increased de novo purine synthesis and increased intracellular concentrations of pp-ribose-p. the latter is a common substrate for the first enzyme of the de novo pathway (phosphoribosyl amidotransferase) and the purine base salvage enzymes. studies in cultured cells from patients, and in mutant cells derived from normal cell lines in vitro, suggest that elevated intracellular pp-ribose-p concentrations may increase the rate of de novo purine biosynthesis. this regulation can be explained in terms of the normal intracellular concentration of pp-ribose-p which is lower tthan the km for the amidotransferase,  and by allosteric activation of this enzyme by pp-ribose-p. feedback inhibition of the first step in the de novo pathway by exogenous purines can be explained either by end-product (nucleotide) inhibition of the amidotransferase, or by competition for pp-ribose-p by the salvage enzymes which have lower km's for this substrate, or by a combination of these effects. evidence for and against these mechanisms is discussed. evidence is presented which suggests that exogenous purines exert a feedback effect, not only on the first step of the de novo pathway, but also at the distal branch point  in the pathway. several potential regulatory

process. in a series of 192 n-balance studies with veal calves it was found, however, that these animals convert at an early age even more than 70 percent of the feed protein into body protein. the deterioration of the n-conversion, so undesirable from a point of view of food production, is found when the animals grow older. with increasing age the conversion ratio went down to approximately 40-50 percent in our studies. this could only be explained by assuming a poorer efficiency of the intermediate metabolic processes with increasing age. for an increase of the production of edible protein from the available feed sources in the world, it is obviously of great importance to maintain the favourable conversion ratio of young farm animals for the longest possible time. the object of this paper is to consider whether and to what extent a positive effect on the efficiency of the protein formation can be exerted by the application of anabolic agents using the veal calf as a model. in the category of artificial estrogens we found des to be effective in this respect. in the category of natural hormones testosterone and progesterone did not exert anabolic effects. the implantation of 17beta-estradiol improved the conversion of feed protein into body protein to approximately the same extent as des. a combination of estradiol with testosterone tended to be more effective than estradiol alone. the more recently isolated agents zeranol and trenbolone did not lead to significant improvements in n-retention. a combination of trenbolone with estradiol improved n-retention better than any of the other treatments. the quantitative importance of the phenomena discussed for protein production is illustrated as follows. with the most effective treatment studied, the percentage of feed protein converted into body protein was increased during an experimental period of 38 days, from 39 percent in the control group to 58 percent in the treated group. there is no

protoporphyrinogen, determined by extraction procedures, was markedly stimulated by addition of nitrate. in contrast, anaerobic protoheme formation from protoporphyrin was not dependent upon addition

oxygen, in contrast to previous observations using mammalian and yeast mitochondria. secondly, these findings help explain the ability of some facultative and anaerobic bacteria to form very large amounts of heme compounds, such as cytochrome pigments, when grown anaerobically in the presence of nitrate or fumarate. in fact, denitrifying bacteria are known to form more cytochromes when grown anaerobically than during aerobic growth. an unexpected finding was that extracts of another bacterium, staphylococcus epidermidis, exhibited very little ability to oxidize protoporphyrinogen to protoporphyrin as compared to e. coli extracts. this finding suggests some fundamental differences in these two organisms in this key step in heme synthesis. it is known that these two facultative

maltose and sucrose were the same in rho and rho strains. specific activities of maltase and invertase were usually higher in the rho-mutants. a very pronounced difference in invertase levels was observed when cells were grown on maltose; rho-mutants had around 30 times more invertase than their rho parent strains. the fact that rho-mutants were much less sensitive to carbon catabolite

inhibited), dinitrophenol (uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation) and of both inhibitors anaerobic conditions and dinitrophenol had no effect on the extent of invertase repression. kcn reduced the degree of repression but not to the level found in rho-mutants. a combination of both inhibitors gave the same results as with kcn alone. erythromycin and chloramphenicol were used as specific inhibitors of mitochondrial protein synthesis. erythromycin prevented the formation of mitochondrial respiratory systems but did not induce rho-mutants under the conditions used. however, repression of invertase was as strong as in the absence of the inhibitor. chloramphenicol led only to a slight reduction of the respiratory systems and did not affect invertase levels. a combination of both

extent of real membrane energization. glucose added after uncoupler can cause only a small increase, and after colicin, a negligible increase in the proline transport rate, indicating that the magnitude of the fluorescence intensity decrease after glucose addition is not a true measure of membrane energization, but rather seems to amplify this energization greatly. glucose addition does not

investigated. nitrogenase activity was strictly dependent on light; no activity was observed in the dark, even when energy (atp) was supplied by oxidative phosphorylation. it was concluded that the low-potential reducing agent required by the nitrogenase-catalyzed reaction could only be generated by a photochemical reaction. nitrogenase biosynthesis was also largely dependent on light; however, a small amount of synthesis was observed in resting cells incubated in the dark. resting cells prepared from dark-grown cultures synthesized nitrogenase at high rates upon illumination. the highest stability of nitrogenase in these resting cells was observed when suspensions were exposed to a diurnal pattern of illumination rather than continuous light. although nitrogenase function and synthesis are closely coupled to photosynthetic activity, the biosyntheses of bacteriochorophyll and nitrogenase are independent of each other and are most probably subject to different regulatory

glucagon on fatty acid synthesis and its stimulatory effect on fatty acid oxidation were largely, but not completely, offset by the simultaneous addition of lactate plus pyruvate. changes in cellular citrate and malonyl-coa levels indicated that glucagon exerted its inhibitory effect on fatty acid synthesis at two levels: (i) blockade of glycolysis; and (ii) partial inhibition of a more distal step, probably acetyl-coa carboxylase. under all conditions, fatty acid oxidation was related in a linear and reciprocal fashion to the rate of fatty acid synthesis and the tissue malonyl-coa content. the latter fluctuated through a range of 1 to 6 nmol per g wet weight of cells. since malonyl-coa inhibits carnitine acyltransferase i of liver mitochondria with a ki in the region of 1 to 2 micron, the present studies support the concept that this compound plays a pivotal role in the coordination of hepatic fatty acid synthesis and oxidation. the ketogenic effect of glucagon on liver appears to

the re-esterification and fatty acid oxidation pathways; and the periphery, by influencing the rate of extrahepatic utilization of ketone bodies. the first two are quantitatively the most important. insulin acts on all three regulatory sites. in adipose tissue lipolysis is inhibited and re-esterification enhanced with consequent decrease of fatty acid release. both these processes are extremely insulin-sensitive. in the liver insulin increases fatty acid synthesis and esterification. at the same time malonyl-coa formation is increased, which inhibits the acylcarnitine transferase system and thus decreases the transport of fatty acids into mitochondria and hence fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis. insulin also has a small stimulatory effect on extrahepatic ketone-body utilization. the effects of glucagon depend on whether insulin is present. in normal man glucagon stimulates insulin secretion and the predominant effect is that of insulin, i.e. decreased ketogenesis. in insulin deficiency glucagon has a mild stimulatory effect on lipolysis, increasing fatty acid supply to the liver. the main effects of glucagon are, however, on the liver. it activates the carnitine acyltransferase system through inhibition of malonyl-coa synthesis. fatty acid oxidation is increased and ketogenesis enhanced. the overall effect on the liver depends on the relative amounts of insulin and glucagon present. studies with somatostatin show that glucagon can increase ketogenesis acutely when insulin secretion is inhibited in normal man, but the effects are short-lived. cortisol has similar effects to glucagon. in the presence of insulin there is a small increase in fatty acid mobilization from adipose tissue, secondary to impaired glucose entry, and perhaps a small effect on lipolysis itself. this fatty acid is, however, directed to triacylglycerol in the liver. in insulin deficiency, again demonstrated by somatostatin infusion, the incoming fatty acidstone-body

cholesterol metabolism in the cobalt-lesioned cortex. a major portion of this free cholesterol appears to be converted to ce, but not to bile acid or neutral sterol (potential products of cholesterol metabolism). the concentration of free fatty acids, the other substrate of ce formation, was decreased in the lesion site. the increased metabolism of cholesterol could not be explained by changes in

amino acid uptake, glycolytic flux, and lactate production; the alterations in glutamine metabolism, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation; the high levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species; the modulation of both fatty acid synthesis and oxidation are hallmarks of the metabolic rewiring induced by hypoxia. this review discusses how metabolic-dependent factors (e.g., increased acidification of tumor microenvironment coupled with intracellular alkalinization, and reduced mitochondrial metabolism), and metabolic-independent factors (e.g., increased expression of drug efflux transporters, stemness maintenance, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition) cooperate in determining chemoresistance in hypoxia. specific metabolic modifiers, however, can reverse the metabolic phenotype of hypoxic tumor areas that are more chemoresistant into the phenotype typical of chemosensitive cells. we propose these metabolic modifiers, able to reverse the hypoxia-induced metabolic rewiring, as potential chemosensitizer agents against hypoxic and refractory tumor cells.", {"entities": [[608, 628, "PATHWAY"], [500, 525, "PATHWAY"]]}], ["tumors remodel their metabolism to support anabolic processes needed for replication, as well as to survive nutrient scarcity and oxidative stress imposed by their changing environment. in most healthy tissues, the shift from anabolism to catabolism results in decreased glycolysis and elevated fatty acid oxidation (fao). this change in the nutrient selected for oxidation is regulated by the glucose-fatty acid cycle, also known as the randle cycle. briefly, this cycle consists of a decrease in glycolysis caused by increased mitochondrial fao in muscle as a result of elevated extracellular fatty acid availability. closing the cycle, increased glycolysis in response to elevated extracellular glucose availability causes a decrease in mitochondrial fao. this competition between glycolysis and fao and its relationship with anabolism and catabolism is conserved in some cancers. accordingly, decreasing glycolysis to lactate, even by diverting pyruvate to mitochondria, can stop proliferation. moreover, colorectal cancer cells can effectively shift to fao to survive both glucose restriction and increases in oxidative stress at the expense of decreasing anabolism. however, a subset of b-cell lymphomas and other cancers require a concurrent increase in mitochondrial fao and glycolysis to support anabolism and proliferation, thus escaping the competing nature of the randle cycle. how mitochondria are remodeled in these fao-dependent lymphomas to preferably oxidize fat, while concurrently sustaining high glycolysis and increasing de novo fatty acid synthesis is unclear. here, we review studies focusing on the role of mitochondrial fao and mitochondrial-driven lipid synthesis in cancer proliferation and survival, specifically in colorectal cancer and lymphomas. we conclude that a specific metabolic liability of these fao-dependent cancers could be a unique remodeling of mitochondrial function that licenses elevated fao concurrent to high glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis. in addition, blocking this mitochondrial remodeling could selectively stop growth of tumors that shifted to mitochondrial fao to survive oxidative stress and nutrient scarcity.", {"entities": [[295, 315,

include hibernation without arousal episodes and capacity to react to external disturbance. we explored circulating lipids in serum and the ecs in plasma and metabolically active tissues in free-ranging subadult scandinavian brown bears when both active and hibernating. in winter bear serum, in addition to a 2-fold increase in total fatty acid concentration, we found significant changes

are identified for its formation. first, the principal one is the decomposition of n5,n10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate (5,10-ch2-thf) to form formaldehyde and thf. increasing the rate of glycine cleavage promotes the formation of 5,10-ch2-thf, thereby increasing the formaldehyde release rate. next, formaldehyde can be produced in the gcs even in the absence of thf. the reason is that t-protein of the gcs can degrade methylamine-loaded h-protein (hint) to formaldehyde and ammonia, accompanied with the formation of dihydrolipoyl h-protein (hred), but the reaction rate is less than 0.16% of that in the presence of thf. increasing t-protein concentration can speed up the release rate of formaldehyde by hint. finally, a certain amount of formaldehyde can be formed in the gcs due

we introduced a novel tumor suppressor gene (tsg), zinc finger dhhc-type containing 1 (zdhhc1, also known as znf377), frequently silenced due to epigenetic modification among various cancers, which exerts significant anti-tumor effects through metabolic regulation. methods: quantitative reversed-transcription pcr (qrt-pcr), reverse transcription pcr (rt-pcr) and western blot were employed to demonstrate transcriptional and protein levels of targeted regulators. methylation of zdhhc1 promoter was detected by bisulfite genomic sequencing (bgs) and methylation specific pcr (msp). proteomics were analyzed by isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (itraq) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms) were utilized for metabolomics analysis. cellular functions were examined via corresponding approaches. nude mice were used for xenograft tumor models. indirect immunofluorescence staining was utilized to obtain precise location and expression of target proteins. oxidative and er stress indicators were detected using specific kits. results: we found that zdhhc1 expression was frequently silenced in multiple tumor cells and specimens due to methylation. restoration of zdhhc1 expression can curb cancer cell progression via stimulating apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, repressing metastasis, and reversing emt transition and cell stemness. zdhhc1's salient anti-tumor

that inhibiting glycolysis reduces renal fibrosis. to address the role of glycolysis in renal fibrosis, we have used a genetic approach. the crucial control point in the rate of glycolysis is 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase. phosphorylation of the kidney isoform, pfkfb2, on residues ser468 and ser485 stimulates glycolysis and is the most important mechanism regulating glycolysis. we generated transgenic mice with inactivating mutations of ser468 and ser485 in pfkfb2 (pfkfb2 ki mice). these mutations were associated with a reduced ability to increase glycolysis in primary cultures of renal tubular cells from pfkfb2 ki mice compared to wt cells. this was associated in pfkfb2 ki mice with increased renal fibrosis, which was more severe in the unilaternal ureteric obstruction (uuo) model compared with the folic acid nephropathy (fan) model. these studies show that phosphorylation of pfkfb2 is important in limiting renal fibrosis after injury, indicating that the ability to regulate and maintain adequate glycolysis in the kidney is crucial for renal homeostasis. the changes were most marked in the uuo model, probably reflecting a greater effect on distal

and female mussels. protein-protein interaction (ppi) networks indicated that protein synthesis and energy metabolism were the main biological processes influenced by tcpp. however, deps involved in these processes and their interaction patterns were quite different between male and female mussels. basically, twelve ribosome deps which directly or indirectly interacted were found in protein synthesis in tcpp-exposed male mussels, while only 3 ribosome deps (not interacted) in tcpp-exposed female mussels. in energy metabolism, only 4 deps (with the relatively simple interaction pattern) mainly resided in fatty acid metabolism, butanoate/propanoate metabolism and glucose metabolism were discovered in tcpp-exposed male mussels, and more deps (with multiple interactions) functioned in tca cycle and pyruvate/glyoxylate/dicarboxylate metabolism were found in tccp-exposed female mussels. taken together, tcpp induced gender-specific toxicological effects in mussels, which may shed new

extensively used as an in vivo efficacy model for chronic human hepatitis b virus infection. under laboratory conditions, woodchucks develop a pseudohibernation condition; thus, the pharmacokinetics (pk) of small-molecule therapeutics may be affected by the seasonal change. the seasonal pk of four probe compounds were characterized over 12 months in seven male and nine female laboratory-maintained woodchucks. these compounds were selected to study changes in oxidative metabolism [antipyrine (ap)], glucuronidation [raltegravir (rtg)], renal clearance [lamivudine (3tc)], and hepatic function [indocyanine green (icg)]. seasonal changes in physiologic parameters and pk were determined. seasonal body weight increases were \u226530%. seasonal changes in body temperature and heart rate were <10%. the mean ap exposure remained unchanged from april to august 2017, followed by a significant increase (\u22651.0-fold) from august to december and subsequent decrease to baseline at the end of study. a similar trend was observed in rtg and 3tc exposures. the icg exposure remained unchanged. no significant sex difference in pk was observed, although female woodchucks appeared to be less susceptible to seasonal pk and body weight changes. significant seasonal pk changes for ap, rtg, and 3tc indicate decreases in oxidative metabolism, phase ii glucuronidation, and renal clearance during pseudohibernation. the lack of seasonal change in icg exposure suggests there are no significant changes in hepatic function. this information can be used to optimize the scheduling of woodchuck studies to avoid seasonally driven variation in drug pk. significance statement: woodchuck is a hibernating species and is commonly used as a nonclinical model of hepatitis b infection. investigation of seasonal pk changes is perhaps of greater interest to pharmaceutical industry scientists, who use the woodchuck model to optimize the scheduling of woodchuck studies to avoid

mitochondrial membrane and subsequent release of the protein cytochrome c into the cytosol, where it can participate in caspase activation via apoptosome formation. interestingly, cytochrome c release is an ancient feature of regulated cell death even in unicellular eukaryotes that do not contain an apoptosome. therefore, it was speculated that cytochrome c release might have an additional, more fundamental role for cell death signalling, because its absence from mitochondria disrupts oxidative phosphorylation. here, we permanently anchored cytochrome c with a transmembrane segment to the inner mitochondrial membrane of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, thereby inhibiting its release from mitochondria during regulated cell death. this cytochrome c retains respiratory growth and correct assembly of mitochondrial respiratory chain supercomplexes. however, membrane anchoring leads to a sensitisation to acetic acid-induced cell death and increased oxidative stress, a compensatory elevation of cellular oxygen-consumption in aged cells and a decreased chronological lifespan. we therefore conclude that loss of cytochrome c from mitochondria during regulated cell death and the subsequent disruption of oxidative phosphorylation is not required for efficient execution of cell death in yeast, and that mobility of cytochrome c within the mitochondrial intermembrane space confers a fitness advantage that overcomes a potential role in regulated cell death signalling in the absence of an apoptosome.", {"entities": [[602, 627, "PATHWAY"], [1327, 1352,

yielded no resistant mutant; whole-genome sequencing of one representative gant-tolerant mutant uncovered mutations in three genes (evgs, arpa, kdpd) potentially linked to protection from gant-mediated killing. subsequent genetic analysis ruled out a role for arpa and kdpd, but two gain-of-function mutations in evgs conferred tolerance. the evgs mutation-mediated gant tolerance depended on evgs to evga phosphor-transfer; evga-mediated up-regulation of gade. ydeo, and sarfa also contributed to tolerance, the latter two likely through their regulation of gade. gant-mediated killing of wild-type cells correlated with increased intracellular ros accumulation that was abolished by the evgs-tolerant mutation. moreover, gant-mediated killing was mitigated by dimethyl sulfoxide, and the evgs-tolerant mutation upregulated genes encoding enzymes involved in ros detoxification and in the glyoxylate shunt of the tca cycle. collectively, these findings indicate that gant kills bacteria through elevation of ros; gain-of-function mutations in evgs confer tolerance by constitutively activating the evga-ydeo/gade cascade of acid-resistance pathways and by preventing gant-stimulated ros accumulation by upregulating ros detoxification and shifting tca cycle carbon flux. the striking lethal activity of gant suggests that clinical use of the agent may not quickly
