[["<h4>background</h4>urea cycle disorders (ucd) and organic acid disorders classically present in the neonatal period. in those who survive, developmental delay is common with continued risk of regression. liver transplantation improves the biochemical abnormality and patient survival is good. we report the neurocognitive and functional outcomes post-transplant for nine ucd, three maple syrup urine disease, and one propionic acidemia patient.<h4>methods</h4>thirteen inborn errors of metabolism (iem) patients were individually one-to-two matched to 26 non-iem patients. all patients received liver transplant. wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare full-scale intelligence-quotient (fsiq) and adaptive behavior assessment system-ii general adaptive composite (gac) at age 4.5 years. dichotomous outcomes were reported as percentages.<h4>results</h4>fsiq and gac median [iqr] was 75 [54, 82.5] and 62.0 [47.5, 83] in iem compared with 94.5 [79.8, 103.5] and 88.0 [74.3, 97.5]

amino acids that are known markers of senescence accumulated strongly under both conditions. however, urea cycle intermediates respond differently between the two treatments. while the levels of both ornithine and citrulline were much higher in plants shifted to 100 ppm co2 compared to those kept in 400 ppm co2, their metabolite abundance did not significantly change in response to a light

in low co2-stressed plants, while the accumulation of other amino acids was reduced by about 50%. gene expression measurements showed a reduction of the entire arginine biosynthetic pathway in

inflammasome activator, is significantly higher in colorectal cancer tissue than in normal intestinal mucosa. however, the mechanism of lps on glycolysis and metastasis has not been fully elucidated. this study aimed to investigate the roles of lps on inflammasome activation, glycolysis, and metastasis, and unravel metformin's potential in treatment of crc.<h4>methods</h4>we detected inflammasome activation and cell motility following lps exposure in crc cell lines. glycolysis analysis was performed, and the key glycolytic rate-limiting enzymes were detected. dual-luciferase reporter gene assay, co-immunoprecipitation, chromatin immunoprecipitation (chip) analysis, and chip-rechip assay were performed to identify the specific mechanisms of lps on glycolysis. mouse metastasis models were used to determine the effects of lps and metformin on metastasis. correlation analysis of the expression of various molecules was performed in 635 crc samples from the cancer genome atlas and 83 crc samples from our lab.<h4>results</h4>lps activates caspase-1 through nf-\u03bab and upregulates the expression of snail and hk3 depending on caspase-1 activation. lps potentiates migration and invasion depending on accelerated glycolysis, which could be reversed by knockdown of glycolytic rate-limiting enzyme hk3. nuclear snail is upregulated by nf-\u03bab under lps treatment and then forms a complex with nf-\u03bab, then directly binds to the hk3 promoter region to upregulate the expression of hk3. metformin suppresses the nf-\u03bab/snail/hk3 signaling axis that is activated by lps and then inhibits lps-induced metastasis. in vivo, lps-treated cells form more metastasis in the lungs of mice, and metformin completely reverses this effect of lps.<h4>conclusion</h4>lps activates inflammasomes in cancer cells through nf-\u03bab and promotes metastasis through glycolysis enhanced by the nf-\u03bab/snail/hk3 signaling pathway in crc. metformin could prevent this effect of lps.",

and the volume available to the bioenergetic machinery. we quantified the energy demands of six drosophila motor nerve terminals through direct measurements of neurotransmitter release and ca 2+ entry, and via theoretical estimates of na + entry and power demands at rest. electron microscopy revealed that terminals with the highest power demands contained the greatest volume of mitochondria, indicating that mitochondria are allocated according to presynaptic power demands. in addition, terminals with the greatest power demand-to-volume ratio (\u223c66 nmol\u00b7min -1 \u00b7\u03bcl -1 )

disease, ad, prevailing until now and formalized as the amyloid cascade hypothesis theory, maintains that the disease is initiated by overproduction of beta-amyloid, a\u03b2, which is generated solely by the a\u03b2 precursor protein, \u03b2app, proteolytic pathway and secreted from the cell. consequent extracellular accumulation of a\u03b2 triggers a cascade of molecular and cellular events leading to neurodegeneration that starts early in life, progresses as one prolonged process, builds up for decades, and culminates in symptomatic manifestations of the disease late in life. in this paradigm, a time window for commencement of therapeutic intervention is small and accessible only early in life. the outlook introduced in the present study is fundamentally different. it posits that the \u03b2app proteolytic/secretory pathway of a\u03b2 production causes ad in humans no more than it does in either short- or long-lived non-human mammals that share this pathway with humans, accumulate beta-amyloid as they age, but do not develop the disease. alzheimer's disease, according to this outlook, is driven by an additional powerful ad-specific pathway of a\u03b2 production that operates in affected humans, is completely independent of the \u03b2app precursor, and is not available in non-human mammals. the role of the \u03b2app proteolytic pathway in the disease in humans is activation of this additional ad-specific a\u03b2 production pathway. this occurs through accumulation of intracellular a\u03b2, primarily via apoe-assisted cellular uptake of secreted beta-amyloid, but also through retention of a fraction of a\u03b2 produced in the \u03b2app proteolytic pathway. with time, accumulated intracellular a\u03b2 triggers mitochondrial dysfunction. in turn, cellular stresses associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, including er stress, activate a second, ad-specific, a\u03b2 production pathway: asymmetric rna-dependent \u03b2app mrna amplification; animal \u03b2app mrna is ineligible for this process. in this pathway, every conventionally produced \u03b2app mrna molecule serves potentially as a template for production of severely 5'-truncated mrna encoding not the \u03b2app but its c99 fragment (hence \"asymmetric\"), the immediate precursor of a\u03b2. thus produced, n-terminal signal peptide-lacking c99 is processed not in the secretory pathway on the plasma membrane, but at the intracellular membrane sites, apparently in a neuron-specific manner. the resulting a\u03b2 is, therefore, not secreted but is retained intraneuronally and accumulates rapidly within the cell. increased levels of intracellular a\u03b2 augment mitochondrial dysfunction, which, in turn, sustains the activity of the \u03b2app mrna amplification pathway. these self-propagating mutual a\u03b2 overproduction/mitochondrial dysfunction feedback cycles constitute a formidable two-stroke engine, an engine that drives alzheimer's disease. the present outlook envisions alzheimer's disorder as a two-stage disease. the first stage is a slow process of intracellular beta-amyloid accumulation. it results neither in significant neurodegenerative damage, nor in manifestation of the disease. the second stage commences with the activation of the \u03b2app mrna amplification pathway shortly before symptomatic onset of the disease, sharply increases the rate of a\u03b2 generation and the extent of its intraneuronal accumulation, produces significant damages, triggers ad symptoms, and is fast. in this paradigm, the time window of therapeutic intervention is wide open, and preventive treatment can be initiated any time, even late in life, prior to commencement of the second stage of the disease. moreover, there are good reasons to believe that with a drug blocking the \u03b2app mrna amplification pathway, it would be possible not only to preempt the disease but also to stop and to reverse it even when early ad symptoms have already manifested. there are numerous experimental models of ad, all based on a notion of the exceptionality of \u03b2app proteolytic/secretory pathway in a\u03b2 production in the disease. however, with no drug even remotely effective in alzheimer's disease, a long list of candidate drugs that succeeded remarkably in animal models, yet failed utterly in human clinical trials of potential ad drugs, attests to the inadequacy of currently employed ad models. the concept of a renewable supply of beta-amyloid, produced in the \u03b2app mrna amplification pathway and retained intraneuronally in alzheimer's disease, explains spectacular failures of both bace inhibition and a\u03b2-immunotherapy in human clinical trials. this concept also forms the basis of a new generation of animal and cell-based experimental models of ad, described in the present study. these models incorporate a\u03b2- or c99-encoding mrna amplification pathways of a\u03b2 production, as well as intracellular retention of their product, and can support not only further investigation of molecular mechanisms of ad but also screening for and testing of candidate drugs aimed at therapeutic targets suggested by the present study.",

lutzii activates glycolysis and fermentation while inactivates aerobic metabolism in iron deprivation, a condition found during infection. in lungs paracoccidioides brasiliensis face a glucose poor environment and relies on the beta-oxidation to support energy requirement. during mycelium to yeast transition p. lutzii cells up-regulate transcripts related to lipid metabolism and cell wall remodeling in order to cope with the host body temperature. paracoccidioides spp. cells also induce transcripts/enzymes of the methylcitrate cycle (mcc), a pathway responsible for propionyl-coa metabolism. propionyl-coa is a toxic compound formed during the degradation of odd-chain fatty acids, branched chain amino acids and cholesterol. therefore, fungi require a functional mcc for full virulence and the ability to metabolize propionyl-coa is related to the virulence traits in paracoccidioides spp. on this way we sought to characterize the propionate metabolism in paracoccidioides spp. the data collected showed that p. lutzii grows in propionate and activates the mcc by accumulating transcripts and proteins of methylcitrate synthase (mcs), methylcitrate dehydratase (mcd) and methylisocitrate lyase (mcl). biochemical characterization of mcs showed that the enzyme is regulated by phosphorylation, an event not yet described. proteomic analyses further indicate that p. lutzii yeast cells degrades lipids and amino acids to support the carbon requirement for propionate metabolism. the induction of a putative propionate kinase suggests that fungal cells use

enalapril significantly reduced cardiac hypertrophy as studied by the heart weight to body weight ratio and mrna expression of fetal genes (anp and \u03b2-mhc). we have observed that tbars, a parameter of lipid peroxidation, was reduced and the antioxidant enzymes (glutathione, catalase, and superoxide dismutase) were improved in the ams and enalapril-cotreated hypertrophic hearts. the extracellular matrix (ecm) components such as matrix metalloproteinases (mmp2 and mmp9) were significantly upregulated in the diseased hearts; however, with the ams and enalapril, it was preserved.

2 kinase (eef2k), resulting in dephosphorylation of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eef2), and the subsequent desuppression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) protein synthesis in the hippocampus. this signaling pathway then potentiates synaptic \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (ampa) receptor responses that results in a novel form of synaptic potentiation which corresponds with antidepressant efficacy. in this chapter, we focus on our studies examining ketamine's action and the instructive role of eef2k in rapid antidepressant action. our recent studies highlight eef2k as a major molecular substrate mediating synaptic plasticity and the rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine.", {"entities": []}], ["there has been much recent progress in understanding of the mechanism of ketamine's rapid and enduring antidepressant effects. here we review recent insights from clinical and preclinical studies, with special emphasis of ketamine-induced changes in gabaergic synaptic transmission that are considered essential for its antidepressant therapeutic effects. subanesthetic ketamine is now understood to exert its initial action by selectively blocking a subset of nmda receptors on gabaergic interneurons, which results in disinhibition of glutamatergic target neurons, a surge in extracellular glutamate and correspondingly elevated glutamatergic synaptic transmission. this surge in glutamate appears to be corroborated by the rapid metabolism of ketamine into hydroxynorketamine, which acts at presynaptic sites to disinhibit the release of glutamate. preclinical studies indicate that glutamate-induced activity triggers the release of bdnf, followed by transient activation of the mtor pathway and increased expression of synaptic proteins, along with functional strengthening of glutamatergic synapses. this drug-on phase lasts for approximately 2h and is followed by a period of days characterized by structural maturation of newly formed glutamatergic synapses and prominently enhanced gabaergic synaptic inhibition. evidence from mouse models with constitutive antidepressant-like phenotypes suggests that this phase involves strengthened inhibition of dendrites by somatostatin-positive gabaergic interneurons and correspondingly reduced nmda receptor-mediated ca2+ entry into dendrites, which activates an intracellular signaling cascade that converges with the mtor pathway onto increased activity of the eukaryotic elongation factor eef2 and enhanced translation of dendritic mrnas. newly synthesized proteins such as bdnf may be important for the prolonged therapeutic effects of ketamine.", {"entities": [[983, 995, "PATHWAY"], [1670, 1682, "PATHWAY"]]}], ["conventional antidepressants typically require weeks of daily dosing to achieve full antidepressant response in antidepressant responders. a newly evolving group of compounds can engender more rapid response times in depressed patients. these drugs include the newly approved antidepressant (s)-ketamine (esketamine, spravato). a seminal study by furey and drevets in 2006 showed antidepressant response in patients after only a few doses with the antimuscarinic drug scopolamine. several clinical reports have generally confirmed scopolamine as a rapid-acting antidepressant. the data with scopolamine are consistent with the adrenergic/cholinergic hypothesis of mania/depression derived from clinical reports originating in the 1970s from janowsky and colleagues. additional support for a role for muscarinic receptors in mood disorders comes from the greater efficacy of conventional antidepressants that have relatively high levels of muscarinic receptor blocking actions (e.g., the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline vs the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine). there appears to be appreciable overlap in the mechanisms of action of scopolamine and other rapid-acting antidepressants (ketamine) or putative rapid-acting agents (mglu2/3 receptor antagonists) although gaps exist in the experimental literature. current hypotheses regarding the mechanisms underlying the rapid antidepressant response to scopolamine posit an m1 receptor subtype-initiated cascade of biological events that involve the amplification of ampa receptors. consequent impact on brain-derived neurotrophic factor and mtor signaling pathways result in the induction of dendritic spines that enable augmented functional connectivity in brain areas regulating mood. two major goals for research

to everolimus. methods bon-1 and everolimus-resistant (er) bon-1 cells were used as in vitro system of sensitivity and acquired resistance. transcriptome changes occurring in bon-1 and er-bon-1 were investigated by rna sequencing and validated by quantitative pcr analysis. rna extracted from patients' biopsies was used to validate myc up-regulation. drug screening and functional assays were performed using er-bon-1 cells. cell cycle progression was evaluated by facs analysis. results our results show that myc overexpression is a key event in the development of secondary resistance to everolimus in pannens cell lines and in metastatic lesions from nen patients. myc knock-down restored er-bon-1 sensitivity to everolimus. pharmacological inhibition of myc mediated by the

for dnam analysis (illumina 850 k array) at a median age of 5.9 years (range 3.1-10.2). dnam age was calculated using two epigenetic clock algorithms (horvath and hannum). the residual resulting from regressing dnam age on chronological age was used as a metric for age acceleration.chronological age was positively correlated with horvath dnam age (r = 0.53, p < 0.0001) and hannum dnam age (r = 0.38, p < 0.0001). offspring age acceleration was higher in the gdm group than non-gdm group after adjustment for potential confounders (horvath: 4.96 months higher, adjusted for sex, pre-pregnancy bmi, cell-type proportions, and technical bias, p = 0.0002; hannum: 11.2 months higher, adjusted for cell-type proportions and technical bias, p < 0.0001). increased offspring dnam age acceleration was associated with increased offspring weight-for-age z-score, bmi-for-age-z-score, waist circumference, body fat percentage, subscapular skinfold, suprailiac skinfold, upper-arm circumference, and blood pressure; findings were stronger in the gdm group.we found that offspring of women with gdm exhibit accelerated epigenetic age compared to control participants, independent of other maternal factors. epigenetic age in offspring was associated with cardiometabolic risk factors, suggesting that gdm and gdm-associated factors may have long-term effects on offspring epigenetic age and

muscle capillary perfusion in response to a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and to test whether these two variables are positively correlated. subsequently, we examined whether t2d-associated skeletal muscle microvascular insulin resistance, as well as overall vascular dysfunction, would be ameliorated by an 8-wk walking intervention (45 min at 60% of heart rate reserve, 5 sessions/week). we report that, relative to healthy subjects, overweight and obese individuals with t2d exhibit depressed insulin-stimulated increases in leg vascular conductance, skeletal muscle capillary perfusion, and akt phosphorylation. notably, we found that within individuals with t2d, those with lesser increases in leg vascular conductance in response to insulin exhibited the lowest increases in muscle capillary perfusion, suggesting that limited muscle capillary perfusion may be, in part, linked to the impaired ability of the upstream resistance vessels to dilate in response to insulin. furthermore, we show that the 8-wk walking intervention, which did not evoke weight loss, was insufficient to ameliorate skeletal muscle microvascular insulin resistance in previously sedentary, overweight/obese subjects with t2d, despite high adherence and tolerance. however, the walking intervention did improve (p < 0.05) popliteal artery flow-mediated dilation (+4.52%) and reduced hba1c (-0.75%). it is possible that physical activity interventions that are longer in duration, engage large muscle groups with recruitment of the maximum number of muscle fibers, and lead to a robust reduction in metabolic risk factors may be required to overhaul microvascular insulin resistance in t2d.new & noteworthy this report provides evidence that in sedentary subjects with type 2 diabetes diminished insulin-stimulated increases in leg vascular conductance and ensuing blunted capillary perfusion in skeletal muscle are not restorable by increased walking alone. more innovative physical activity interventions that ultimately result in a robust mitigation of metabolic risk factors may be vital for reestablishing skeletal muscle microvascular insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetes.",

with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (amci), a prodromal stage of clinical alzheimer disease (ad). forty-two patients with amci and 24 cognitively normal older adults (nc) of similar age, sex, and education underwent stepwise decreases and increases in mean arterial pressure (map) induced by intravenous infusion of sodium nitroprusside and phenylephrine, respectively. changes in cerebral blood flow (cbf) were measured repeatedly in the internal carotid and vertebral artery. linear mixed modeling, including random effects of both individual intercept and regression slope, was used to quantify the map-cbf relationship accounting for nonindependent, repeated cbf measures. changes in end-tidal co2 (etco2) associated with changes in map were also included in the model to account for their effects on cbf. marginal mean values of map were reduced by 13-14 mmhg during sodium nitroprusside and increased by 20-24 mmhg during phenylephrine infusion in both groups with similar doses of drug infusion. a steeper slope of changes in cbf in response to changes in map was observed in amci relative to nc, indicating reduced efficacy of ca (map \u00d7 group, p = 0.040). these findings suggest that cerebrovascular dysfunction may occur early in the development of ad.new & noteworthy cerebral autoregulation is a fundamental regulatory mechanism to protect brain perfusion against changes in blood pressure that, if impaired, may contribute to the development of alzheimer's disease. using a linear mixed model, we demonstrated that the efficacy of cerebral autoregulation, assessed during stepwise changes in arterial pressure, was reduced in individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment, a prodromal stage of alzheimer's disease. these findings support the

study, we investigated the influence of storage time, material, temperature, and freeze-thaw cycles on stability of global dna (hydroxy)methylation.edta blood was collected from 90 individuals. blood (n\u00a0=\u00a030, group 1) and extracted dna (n\u00a0=\u00a030, group 2) were stored at 4\u00b0c, -20\u00b0c and -80\u00b0c for 0, 1 (endpoint blood 4\u00b0c), 6, 12 or 18\u00a0months. additionally, freeze-thaw cycles of blood and dna samples (n\u00a0=\u00a030, group 3) were performed over three days. global dna methylation and hydroxymethylation (mean \u00b1 sd) were quantified using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (lc-esi-ms/ms) with between-run precision of 2.8% (methylation) and 6.3% (hydroxymethylation). effects on stability were assessed using linear mixed models.global dna methylation was stable over 18\u00a0months in blood at -20\u00b0c and -80\u00b0c and dna at 4\u00b0c and -80\u00b0c. however, at 18\u00a0months dna methylation from dna stored at -20\u00b0c relatively decreased -6.1% compared to baseline. global dna hydroxymethylation was more stable in dna samples compared to blood, independent of temperature (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0131). stability of global dna methylation and hydroxymethylation was not affected up to three freeze - thaw cycles.global dna methylation and hydroxymethylation stored as blood and dna can be used for epigenetic studies. the relevance of\u00a0 small differences occuring during storage depend on the expected effect size and research question.", {"entities": [[650, 665, "PATHWAY"], [957, 972,
